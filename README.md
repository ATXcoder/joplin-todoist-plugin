# Joplin to Todist

This [Joplin](#) plugin allows you to create a [Todoist](#) task directly from Joplin.

I use Todoist to manage all my personal and professional tasks and Joplin to store all my notes. I needed a way to quickly create tasks in Todoist directly from Joplin while also tieing the task to the current Joplin note. I wrote this plugin that exactly that.

## Features
